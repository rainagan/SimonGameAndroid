# Simon Game (Andoid Version)
Simon Game shows a number of buttons to the user and creates a series of button press result and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user successfully repeat the series, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
